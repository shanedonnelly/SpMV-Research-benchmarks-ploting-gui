We need to refactor and structure the app, but do not change the core logic of this component, except for:

Add a parameter show_df_by_default (default: True) to control the default value of the show df state.

Remove the title from the component. Do not change add any other changes ! do not invent things, this component should stay intact. 

Then, move this component into its own file.

Component purpose:
It takes a dataframe as input , the max_unique values (default 20) and the show_df_by_default (default true ) and returns the filtered dataframe, just like before.
The component contains the dataframe vizualizer ! int not in the main !

Application structure
1. setup.py
This script runs when the app is not running, and performs initial setup:

Creates a config file (add show_df_by_default as a new config option).

Converts all CSV files in the csv/ folder to Pickle format in the pickle/ folder.

The pickle files must keep the same name as the original CSV.

2. Main Component
This is the core interface, and includes:

- A settings icon
Opens a UI to permanently edit the config file.

- Two main pages:
Page 1: Data Filtering
Dataframe selector : 
Dropdown listing available Pickle files from pickle/.
By default, it loads the first file in the list. and really load it to the filtering component (without need of clicking ok for this first default dataframe )
You must click OK to confirm selection (when choosing a different one than defualt ).
The selected dataframe is passed to the previously described filter component.

Save Subset button (centered below the filter )
Saves the currently filtered dataframe as a new Pickle file in the same folder.
Naming convention:

If original file is dataframe.pkl, new files are saved as dataframe_1.pkl, dataframe_2.pkl, etc.

It always finds the next last index (if dataframe and dataframe_2, next is _3, not _1)

 Page 2: Plotting
Contains a basic subset manager (for now) (this component is collapsable ):

Allows deleting subset files (actual file deletion).
Allows renaming subsets (will affect the file name). 


Allows selecting one or more subsets for the future. (not collapsale ) : simple checkbox select. 
Let a big empty space for the futur 

Page disposal : 
Do not create a column or any kind of space-taking component for switching pags, make the switch of the pages at the very top, like a web navigator kind of page selector, very simple. 

Overall : do not invent anything i didnt say, do not add smiley.
