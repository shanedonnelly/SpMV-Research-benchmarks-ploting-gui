We need to refactor and structure the app, but do not change the core logic of this component, except for:

Add a parameter show_df_by_default (default: True) to control the default value of the show df state.

Remove the title from the component.

Then, move this component into its own file.

Component purpose:
It takes a dataframe as input and returns the filtered dataframe, just like before.

Application structure
1. setup.py
This script runs when the app is not running, and performs initial setup:

Creates a config file (add show_df_by_default as a new config option).

Converts all CSV files in the csv/ folder to Pickle format in the pickle/ folder.

The pickle files must keep the same name as the original CSV.

2. Main Component
This is the core interface, and includes:

- A settings icon
Opens a UI to permanently edit the config file.

- Two main pages:
ðŸ“„ Page 1: Data Filtering
Dataframe selector : 
Dropdown listing available Pickle files from pickle/.
By default, it loads the first file in the list.
You must click OK to confirm selection.
The selected dataframe is passed to the previously described filter component.

Save Subset button (centered below)
Saves the currently filtered dataframe as a new Pickle file in the same folder.
Naming convention:

If original file is dataframe.pkl, new files are saved as dataframe_1.pkl, dataframe_2.pkl, etc.

It always finds the next last index 

ðŸ“Š Page 2: Plotting
Contains a basic subset manager (for now) (this component is collapsable ):

Allows deleting subset files (actual file deletion).
Allows renaming subsets (will affect the file name). 


Allows selecting one or more subsets for the future. (not collapsale ) : simple checkbox select. 
Let a big empty space for the futur
